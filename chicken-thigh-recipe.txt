Basic Recipe for Oven-Baked Chicken Thighs

4 chicken thighs, boneless/skinless or bone-in, skin-on (1 1/2 to 2 pounds)

Juice of 1 lemon

1/4 cup olive oil

Sea salt and pepper to taste

Mix together the lemon juice, olive and sea salt and pepper in a bag. Add the chicken thighs to the marinade, making sure both sides touch the sauce. Let rest in the marinade for a half-hour, minimum, or overnight in the fridge.

Note: If you choose to marinate in advance and refrigerate overnight, be sure to let your chicken come to room temperature before baking.

Preheat the oven to 425 F and line a baking sheet with foil. This will make the cleanup much easier.

Pull your thighs out of the marinade and lay them on the baking sheet. If using bone-in thighs, keep the skin up so it'll get crispy. Add sea salt and pepper to both sides. Bake for 40 minutes if using bone-in; about half that, or 20 minutes for the boneless. Turn the thighs once while baking. Check for doneness; the internal temperature should read 160 F.

Makes 4 servings.
